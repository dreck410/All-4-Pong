Welcome to All-4-Pong
This is a four player Pong based game.  To play by yourself simply 
compile the program and play. To play with a friend have him compile the client 
input your computers IP address (Make sure your all on the same WIFI)
And click play!

This is one of my first projects for a class I did. It was a group project
would appreciate any form of feedback!
